# TextGenerator

# Description of Text Generator Tool 

A **text generation tool** leverages artificial intelligence to automatically produce coherent and contextually relevant text based on user input. It utilizes **pre-trained models** like OpenAI's GPT or Google's T5, which are large-scale deep learning models trained on diverse text datasets. 

### Key Features:
1. **Pre-trained Model:** These models are pre-trained on massive datasets (e.g., books, articles, and online content), enabling them to understand grammar, context, and even nuanced expressions.
2. **Customization:** Users can fine-tune the model to generate content for specific applications like creative writing, summarization, code generation, or chatbot responses.
3. **Applications:** Text generation tools are used in content creation, virtual assistants, conversational AI, code writing, and more.
4. **Input-to-Output Workflow:** The user provides a prompt or seed text, and the model generates a response, continuing or expanding upon the input.

For example, **GPT-based tools** can generate emails, articles, or creative stories, while models like **T5** excel at summarization or translation tasks. These tools significantly reduce the time and effort required for content creation while maintaining quality and relevance.

# Input 

GPT-Based Text Generator

Enter prompt:
Explain supervised learning using an example .
Enter max tokens (e.g. 100): 95
Enter creativity (0.0 - 1.0): 0.6

# Output 

Generated Text:

**Supervised learning** is a type of machine learning where the model is trained on a labeled dataset. This means that each training example is paired with an output label. The goal of the model is to learn a mapping from inputs to the correct output so that it can predict the label for new, unseen data.

### Example of Supervised Learning:

**Task:** Email Spam Detection

- **Input:** Email text or features extracted from the email (e.g., presence of
